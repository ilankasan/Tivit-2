What happens if I created a tivit to someone on someone else's activity? Changes in bold below. 
Other's activity:
Only show the activity if I have a tivit there and it's not completed yet. If I completed all my tivits in others activity, only show it if:
Other tivits I participated in the discussion had new comments
Someone commented it my tivit
There's an update on a tivit I created for someone else
                      Otherwise, don't show the activity at all.
My tivits should show up at the top
Only show other team tivits IF I ever participated in the discussion and there's a status change or new comment there
Don't show closed/completed activities

My Activities
Always show all my Activites that are not closed - so I could close it
Show the following tivits in each activity:
Not completed (basically everything that is not yet completed - on it, in progress, late, etc.)
Completed that had new comments on it
