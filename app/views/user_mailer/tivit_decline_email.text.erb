<%= @assignee.get_name %> is unfortunately unable to help you with '<%=@tivit.name%>'.
Is there someone else who can help?

	<%= @assignee.get_name %> says: "<%= @comment %>"
<%end%>
              
<%= link_to 'Go to your activity', activity_url(@tivit.get_parent) %>to ask for more help and to track its progress.
